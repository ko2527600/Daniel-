            <h3><span>Web Developer</span> based in Ghana</h3>
            <p>I’m a programming student with a strong interest in web development,
               software engineering, and problem-solving. I’ve been learning and building projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
               and I enjoy turning ideas into practical, user-friendly solutions. I’m always eager to explore new technologies,
               improve my coding skills, and take on challenges that help me grow as a developer. My goal is to build a solid foundation in 
               programming while exploring areas like artificial intelligence and full-stack development. This portfolio showcases some of the 
               work I’ve done so far and reflects my commitment to learning and improving in the tech space.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Mensah, a passionate and detail-oriented software engineer with a focus on creating intuitive and visually engaging user experiences.
             I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant solutions through clean code and thoughtful design. With a background in web development, 
             I’ve worked on projects ranging from small personal websites to larger, collaborative web applications.

            staying current with the latest trends in the industry. Outside of coding, 
            you’ll often find me either playing pool or the drums or simply exploring new ideas and challenges.</p>
